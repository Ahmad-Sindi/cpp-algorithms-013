# 🚀 Algorithm Challenge #13 — Max of Three Numbers

### 🧠 Description:
This program asks the user to input **three numbers** and determines which one is the **largest**.  
If two or more numbers are equal, it still correctly identifies the maximum.

### 💡 What You’ll Learn:
- Using multiple logical comparisons (`&&`)
- Understanding `if-else if-else` decision structures
- Handling equality and comparison logic

### 🧾 Example Output:
Please enter 3 numbers:
10 25 15
The highest number is the second one: 25

**Equal case:**
Please enter 3 numbers:
30 30 25
